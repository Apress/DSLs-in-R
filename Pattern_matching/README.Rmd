# Pattern matching

In languages such as ML or Haskell, you can define data types by specifying functions you will use to construct values of any given type. In itself, that is not that interesting, but combined with a pattern matching feature of these languages, you can write very succinct functions for transforming data structures.

In my book on *Functional Data Structures in R* [@Mailund:2017ul], I describe several algorithms that depend on the transformation of various trees based on their structure. Such transformations involve figuring out the current structure of a tree—does it have a left sub-tree? Is that tree a leaf? If it is a red-black search tree, what is the colour of the tree? And the colour of its right sub-tree? In the algorithms, I presented in that book, most of the functions contained tens of lines of code just for matching such tree structure.

With the language we implement in this chapter, we will make writing such transformation functions vastly more efficient. We will write two main constructions. The first for defining a data structure, which we can use to define red-black search trees like this:

```r
colour := R | B
rb_tree := E | T(col : colour, left : rb_tree, value, right : rb_tree)
```

The second constructing is used to match values of such types and then perform actions accordingly. A balancing function for red-black search trees can be implemented succinctly like this:

```r
balance <- function(tree) {
  cases(tree,
        T(B,T(R,a,x,T(R,b,y,c)),z,d) -> T(R,T(B,a,x,b),y,T(B,c,z,d)),
        T(B,T(R,T(R,a,x,b),y,c),z,d) -> T(R,T(B,a,x,b),y,T(B,c,z,d)),
        T(B,a,x,T(R,b,y,T(R,c,z,d))) -> T(R,T(B,a,x,b),y,T(B,c,z,d)),
        T(B,a,x,T(R,T(R,b,y,c),z,d)) -> T(R,T(B,a,x,b),y,T(B,c,z,d)),
        otherwise -> tree)
}
```

This function is mere eight lines, compared to the 42 lines of code used in *Functional Data Structures in R*, where I also use some pattern matching tricks but not a domain-specific language uniquely designed for it. Such a language is what we will implement in this chapter.

For the chapter, we need to will use the following packages:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(magrittr, quietly = TRUE))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(rlang, quietly = TRUE))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr, quietly = TRUE))
```
```r
library(rlang)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
```

We will also need the `make_args_list` function we defined in [Chapter @sec:lambda].

```{r}
make_args_list <- function(args) {
  res <- replicate(length(args), substitute())
  names(res) <- args
  as.pairlist(res)
}
```

For a package that implements the functionality described in this chapter, and more, see [https://mailund.github.io/pmatch/](https://mailund.github.io/pmatch/).

## Constructors

The key feature of this domain-specific language is the type constructors—how we define values of a given type. The pattern matching aspect of the DSL will consist of nested constructor calls, so it is how we define the constructors that is the essential aspect of the language.

Here, we are inspired by function calls. We will use a syntax for constructors that matches variables and function calls:

```
TYPEDEF ::= TYPENAME ':=' CONSTUCTORS
CONSTUCTORS ::= CONSTUCTOR | CONSTUCTOR '|' CONSTRUCTORS
CONSTRUCTOR ::= NAME | NAME '(' ARGS ')'
ARGS ::= ARG | ARG ',' ARGS
ARG ::= NAME | NAME : TYPE
TYPE ::= NAME
```

We define a new type by giving it a name, to the left of a `:=` operator, and by putting a sequence of constructors on the right of the `:=` operator. Constructors, then, are separated by `|` and are either single names or a name followed by arguments in parentheses, where an argument is either a single name or a name followed by ':' and then a type, where we require that a type is a name.

We implement this grammar by implementing the `:=` operator. An assignment has the lowest precedence, which means that whatever we write to the left or right of this operator will be arguments to the function. We do not have to worry about an expression in our language being translated into some `call` object of a different type. We cannot override the other assignment operators, `<-`, `->` and `=`, so we have to use `:=`. Since this is also traditionally used to mean “defined to be equal to”, it works quite well.

The approach we take in implementing this part of the pattern matching DSL is different from the examples we have seen earlier. We do not create a data structure that we can analyse nor do we evaluate expressions directly from expressions in our new language. Instead, we combine parsing expressions with code generation—we generate new functions and objects while we parse the specification. We add these functions, and other objects for constants, to the environment in which we call `:=`. Adding these objects to this environment allows us to use the constructors after we have defined them with no further coding, but it does mean that calling `:=` will have side-effects.

The construction function will expect a type name as its left-hand-side parameter and an expression describing the different ways of constructing elements of the type on its right-hand side. We will translate the left-hand side into a quosure because we want to get its associated environment. The right-hand side we will turn into an expression. For the construction specification, we do not want to evaluate any of the elements (unless the user invokes quasi-quotations). The left-hand side—the type we are defining—is just treated as a string, since that is how the S3 system deals with types, so we will make sure that it is a single symbol and then get the string representation of it. For this, we can use the `quo_name` function from `rlang`. The right-hand side we have to parse, but we delegate this to a separate function that we define below. Finally, we specify a function for pretty-printing elements of the new type we define.

```{r}
`:=` <- function(data_type, constructors) {
  data_type <- enquo(data_type)
  constructors <- enexpr(constructors)

  stopifnot(quo_is_symbol(data_type))
  data_type_name <- quo_name(data_type)
  process_alternatives(
    constructors, 
    data_type_name, 
    get_env(data_type)
  )

  assign(paste0("toString.", data_type_name),
         deparse_construction, envir = get_env(data_type))
  assign(paste0("print.", data_type_name),
         construction_printer, envir = get_env(data_type))
}
```

The last two statements in this function, the calls to `assign`, creates functions for printing elements of the type we are creating. We will implement the `deparse_construction` and `construction_printer` functions below. They extract information about values from meta-information we will store in objects of the new type, and we can use the same functions for all types we define in our language. We use them to specialise the `toString` and `print` functions for this specific type. The `paste0` calls create the names of the specialisations of the generic `toString` and `print` functions. The `assign` function then stores `deparse_construction` and `construction_printer` under the appropriate names in the environment we get from `get_env(data_type)`, i.e., the environment where we define the type.

The expression on the right-hand side of `:=` defines how we construct elements of the new type. We allow there to be more than one way to do this, and we separate the various choices using the or-operator `|`. This approach resembles how we describe different alternatives when we specify a grammar, so it is a natural choice. To process the right-hand side, we use the function `process_alternatives`.

```{r}
process_alternatives <- function(constructors,
                                 data_type_name,
                                 env) {
  if (is_lang(constructors) && constructors[[1]] == "|") {
    process_alternatives(
      constructors[[2]],
      data_type_name,
      env
    )
    process_alternatives(
      constructors[[3]],
      data_type_name,
      env
    )
  } else {
    process_constructor(
      constructors,
      data_type_name,
      env
    )
  }
}
```

In addition to the constructor expression, we pass the name of the type and the environment we are defining it in as parameters. We do not use these directly in this function but merely pass them along. We will use them later when we create the actual constructors.

The `process_alternatives` function recursively parse the expression to get all alternatives separated by `|`. The actual constructors will be either a function or a symbol, so the constructor specifications will not have higher precedence than the *or* operator. The first time we see something that isn’t a call to `|`, then, we have a constructor. We handle those using the `process_constructor` function.

```{r}
process_constructor <- function(constructor, 
                                data_type_name,
                                env) {
  if (is_lang(constructor)) {
    process_constructor_function(
      constructor,
      data_type_name,
      env
    )
  } else {
    process_constructor_constant(
      constructor,
      data_type_name,
      env
    )
  }
}
```

This function figures out if what we are looking at is a function constructor or a constant, i.e., a symbol. We use the `is_lang` function to test if we are looking at a function. It does the same as `is.call` from the `base` package; I just prefer the `rlang` functions for this chapter.

Constant constructors are the simplest. They are merely symbols so to make them available for programmers; we need to define a value for each such symbol. We will use `NA` as the value of these variables and store some meta-information with them. We set the class, so the `construction_printer` function will be called when we try to print the object, and we set the attribute `constructor_constant` that we will later need for pattern matching.

```{r}
process_constructor_constant <- function(constructor,
                                         data_type_name, 
                                         env) {
  stopifnot(is_symbol(constructor))
  constructor_name <- as_string(constructor)
  constructor_object <- structure(
    NA,
    constructor_constant = constructor_name,
    class = data_type_name
  )
  assign(constructor_name, constructor_object, envir = env)
}
```

For the function constructors that we need to create, you guessed it, functions. We analyse the arguments given to the constructor specification and build a function out of that, and this function we then store in the environment where the constructor is defined. We permit two kinds of parameters to a constructor: either a symbol or a symbol with a type. For the latter, we use the `:` operator. If a parameter is a `:` call, then we consider the left-hand side the parameter and the right-hand side the type. We use the types to guarantee that values we construct are of the expected kind. If there is no type specified, we will allow a parameter to hold any value. We use the following function to translate the list of parameters from a function constructor expression into a data frame where the first column holds the argument names and the second column holds their type. We use `NA` to indicate that we allow any type. The function works by first translating the arguments—that are in the form of a `call` object—into a list. We have to use the base `as.list` function for this, rather than the `rlang` `as_list`, since the latter will not translate `call` objects into lists. Once we have the arguments as a list, we map the `process_arg` function over the elements. This function creates a row for the data frame per element, and we combine the rows using the `bind_rows` function from `dplyr`.

```{r}
process_arguments <- function(constructor_arguments) {
  process_arg <- function(argument) {
    if (is_lang(argument)) {
      stopifnot(argument[[1]] == ":")
      arg <- quo_name(argument[[2]])
      type <- quo_name(argument[[3]])
      tibble::tibble(arg = arg, type = type)
    } else {
      arg <- quo_name(argument)
      tibble::tibble(arg = arg, type = NA)
    }
  }
  constructor_arguments %>% 
    as.list %>% 
    purrr::map(process_arg) %>%   
    bind_rows
}
```

The `process_constructor_function` translates a function construction specification into a function. The first element of the specifications, which is a `call` object, is the name of the function. The remaining elements, we translate into a data frame using the function we just saw. After that, we need to create the function that will work as the constructor. Here, we create a closure without arguments and then add formal parameters afterwards, as we did in the previous chapter, and we get the actual parameters that the closure is called with using the `as_list(environment())` trick.

The value we return from the closure is just the list of arguments that are provided to it but tagged with a `constructor` attribute we can use for pattern matching and a `class` set to the type we are defining, something we use for type checking. The type checking is the chief part of the constructor. Here, we check that we get the right number of arguments and that they have the right type if a type was specified.

Once we have created the closure and set its formal arguments, we also update its class, so it is both a `constructor` and a `function`. Giving constructor functions the class `constructor` is also something we will need when pattern matching. Then we assign it to the environment associated with the specification to make it available to the programmer.

```{r}
process_constructor_function <- function(constructor,
                                         data_type_name,
                                         env) {
  stopifnot(is_lang(constructor))
  constructor_name <- quo_name(constructor[[1]])
  constructor_arguments <- process_arguments(constructor[-1])

  # Create the constructor function
  constructor <- function() {
    args <- as_list(environment())

    # Type check!
    stopifnot(length(args) == length(constructor_arguments$arg))
    for (i in seq_along(args)) {
      arg <- args[[constructor_arguments$arg[i]]]
      type <- constructor_arguments$type[i]
      stopifnot(is_na(type) || inherits(arg, type))
    }

    structure(args,
              constructor = constructor_name,
              class = data_type_name)
  }
  formals(constructor) <- make_args_list(constructor_arguments$arg)

  # Set meta information about the constructor
  class(constructor) <- c("constructor", "function")

  # Put the constructor in the binding scope
  assign(constructor_name, constructor, envir = env)
}
```

The only remaining function to write for the constructors is the function for printing them. Here, we write a function that translates a constructed object into a string; this function we can then use recursively to translate any constructed element into a string. We then just call this function in `construction_printer` which is the function that is assigned to the specialised `print` function for any type we define.

There is nothing complicated in the function. We first check if the object has an attribute “constructor”. Strictly speaking, only the function constructors have this—the constant constructors have the attribute “constructor_constant”, but the `attire` function will pick an attribute if it gets a unique prefix, so we also get that. If we do not have a “constructor” attribute, then it isn’t an element constructed from something we have defined from our language, so it must be a value of some other type—we just convert it into a string and return this. We use the generic `toString` function for this. This function converts any object into a string. Not necessarily a beautiful representation of the object, but you can specialise it if you need to.

If the object we have *is* a constructor, it is either a constant or the result of a constructor function call. If the latter, it will be a list. If it is a list, then we must convert all the elements in the list into strings and paste them together. Otherwise, the name of the constructor is the string representation of the object.

```{r}
deparse_construction <- function(object) {
  constructor_name <- attr(object, "constructor")
  if (is_null(constructor_name)) {
    # This is not a constructor, so just get the value
    return(toString(object))
  }

  if (is_list(object)) {
    components <- names(object)
    values <- as_list(object) %>% purrr::map(deparse_construction)

    print_args <- vector("character", length = length(components))
    for (i in seq_along(components)) {
      print_args[i] <- paste0(components[i], "=", values[i])
    }
    print_args <- paste0(print_args, collapse = ", ")
    paste0(constructor_name, "(", print_args, ")")

  } else {
    constructor_name
  }
}
construction_printer <- function(x, ...) {
  cat(deparse_construction(x), "\\n")
}
```

As an example of using the construction language we can define a binary tree as either a tree with a left and right sub-tree or a leaf:

```{r}
tree := T(left : tree, right : tree) | L(value : numeric)
```

We can use the constructors to create a tree:

```{r}
x <- T(T(L(1),L(2)),L(3))
x
```

Values we create using these constructors can be accessed just as lists—which, in fact, they are—using the variable names we used in the type specification:

```{r}
x$left$left$value
x$left$right$value
x$right$value
```

The type checking is rather strict, however. We demand that the values we pass to the constructor functions are of the types we give in the specification—in the sense that they must inherit the class from the specification—and this can be a problem in some cases where R would otherwise ordinarily just convert values. In the specification for the `L` constructor, for example, we require that the argument is `numeric`. We will get an error if we give it an `integer`:

```{r}
L(1L)
```

This situation is where we can use the variant of parameters without a type:

```{r}
tree := T(left : tree, right : tree) | L(value)
L(1L)
```

An alternative solution could be to specify more than one type in the specification. If you are interested, you can play with that. I will just leave it here and move on to pattern matching.

## Pattern matching

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#install.packages("pmatch")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(pmatch, quietly = TRUE))
```

We want to implement pattern matching such that an expression like this

```{r}
cases(L(1),
      L(v) -> v,
      T(L(v), L(w)) -> v + w,
      otherwise -> 5)
```

should return 1, since the pattern `L(v)` matches the value `L(1)` and we return `v`, which we expect to be bound to 1. Likewise, we want this expression to return nine since `v` should be bound to 4 and `w` to 5 and we return the result of evaluating `v + w`.

```{r}
cases(T(L(4), L(5)),
      L(v) -> v,
      T(L(v), L(w)) -> v + w,
      otherwise -> 5)
```

We want the `otherwise` keyword to mean anything at all and use it as a default pattern, so in this expression, we want to return five.

```{r}
cases(T(L(1), T(L(4), L(5))),
      L(v) -> v,
      T(L(v), L(w)) -> v + w,
      otherwise -> 5)
```

The syntax for pattern matching uses the right-arrow operator. This operator is usually an assignment. We cannot specialise arrow assignments, but we can still use them in a meta-programming function. We use an assignment operator for the same reasons as we had for using the `:=` operator for defining types. Since assignment operators have the lowest precedence, we don’t have to worry about how tight the operators to the left and right of the operator binds. We could also have used that operator here, but I like the arrow more for this function. It shows us what different patterns map to. You need to be careful with the `->` operator, though, since it is syntactic sugar for `<-`. This means that once we have an expression that uses `->`, we will actually see a call to `<-` and the left- and right-hand sides will be switched.

The `cases` function will take a variable number of arguments. The first is the expression we match against, and the rest are captured by the three-dots operator. The expressions there should not be evaluated directly, so we capture them as quosures. We then iterate through them, split them into left-hand and right-hand sides, and test the left-hand side against the expression. The function we use for testing the pattern will return an environment that contains bound variables if it matches, and `NULL` otherwise. If we have a match, we evaluate the right-hand side in the quosure environment over-scoped by the environment we get from matching the pattern.

```{r}
cases <- function(expr, ...) {
  matchings <- quos(...)

  for (i in seq_along(matchings)) {
    eval_env <- get_env(matchings[[i]])
    match_expr <- quo_expr(matchings[[i]])
    stopifnot(match_expr[[1]] == "<-")

    test_expr <- match_expr[[3]]
    result_expr <- match_expr[[2]]

    match <- test_pattern(expr, test_expr, eval_env)
    if (!is_null(match))
      return(eval_tidy(result_expr, data = match, env = eval_env))
  }

  stop("No matching pattern!")
}
```

In the `test_pattern` function we create the environment where we will bind matched variables. If the pattern is `otherwise`, we return the empty environment—no variables are bound there. Otherwise, we need to explore both pattern and expression recursively.

We use the function `test_pattern_rec` to do this, but we do not call it directly. Instead, we use a function called `callCC`. The name stands for *call with current continuation*, and it is a function that sometimes causes some confusion for people not intimately familiar with functional programming. There is no need for this confusions, however, because all the function does is provide us with a way to return to the point where we called `callCC`.

We wrap the `test_pattern_rec` function in a closure, `tester`, that is called with a function that we call `escape`. This is the function that `callCC` will provide. If, at any point, we call the function `escape`, it will terminate whatever we are doing and return to the point where we called `callCC`. This means that we can use `escape` to get out of deep recursions if we find out at some point that the pattern doesn’t match the expression. We do not need to propagate a failed match up the call stack through the recursive function calls. As soon as we call `escape` we are taken back to the end of `test_pattern`. Whatever we called `escape` with—it is a function of a single parameter—will be the return value of the `callCC` call. So, if we find that a pattern doesn’t match, we will call `escape` with `NULL`. This will then be the result of `test_pattern`. If we never call `escape`, but instead return normally from `test_pattern_rec`, then what we return from that function will also be the return value of the `callCC` call. So, if we match the pattern and return an environment from `test_pattern_rec`, this will also be the return value of the `test_pattern` call.

```{r}
test_pattern <- function(expr, test_expr, eval_env) {
  # Environment in which to store matched variables
  match_env <- env()

  if (test_expr == quote(otherwise))
    return(match_env)

  # Test pattern
  tester <- function(escape)
    test_pattern_rec(escape, expr, test_expr, 
                     eval_env, match_env)
  callCC(tester)
}
```

It is in `test_pattern_rec` the real work is done. It analyses the pattern expression, stored in the `test_expr` variable, and matches it against the value stored in the `expr` variable. It also takes two environments as parameters, one is the environment where the expression and pattern are defined—it needs this environment to look up variables to check what they are—and the other is the environment in which it should bind variables from the pattern. It, of course, also knows the `escape` function that it can use if it finds out that the pattern isn’t matching.

```{r}
test_pattern_rec <- function(escape, expr, test_expr,
                             eval_env, match_env) {

  # Is this a function-constructor?
  if (is_lang(test_expr)) {
    func <- get(as_string(test_expr[[1]]), eval_env)
    
    if (inherits(func, "constructor")) {
      # This is a constructor.
      # Check if it is the right kind
      constructor <- as_string(test_expr[[1]])
      expr_constructor <- attr(expr, "constructor")
      if (is_null(expr_constructor) || 
          constructor != expr_constructor)
        escape(NULL) # wrong type

      # Now check recursively
      for (i in seq_along(expr)) {
        test_pattern_rec(
          escape, 
          expr[[i]], test_expr[[i+1]],
          eval_env, match_env
        )
      }

      # If we get here, the matching was successfull
      return(match_env)
    }
  }

  # Is this a constant-constructor?
  if (is_symbol(test_expr) && 
      exists(as_string(test_expr), eval_env)) {
    constructor <- as_string(test_expr)
    val <- get(constructor, eval_env)
    val_constructor <- attr(val, "constructor_constant")
    if (!is_null(val_constructor)) {
      expr_constructor <- attr(expr, "constructor")
      if (is_null(expr) || constructor != expr_constructor)
        escape(NULL) # wrong type
      else
        return(match_env) # Successfull match
    }
  }

  # Not a constructor.
  # Must be a value to compare with or a variable to bind to
  if (is_symbol(test_expr)) {
    assign(as_string(test_expr), expr, match_env)
  } else {
    value <- eval_tidy(test_expr, eval_env)
    if (expr != value) escape(NULL)
  }

  match_env
}
```

There are three cases to consider: The `test_expr` is a constructor function, a constructor constant, or something else.

If `test_expr` is a function call, we test this using `is_lang` from `rlang`, then it might be a function constructor. To figure out if it is, we look the function name up in the evaluation environment, i.e., the environment where the test pattern was written. We then test if the function inherits `"constructor"`. The functions we create in our DSL will also be constructor objects, so if it does, we know we have such one. We then check if `expr` has an attribute `"constructor"`. If it was generated by a call to a constructor, it will. If it doesn’t, then we cannot have a match and we escape with `NULL`. We also escape if the names of the constructors do not match. If they do, we iterate through all the elements in the pattern and expression calls and attempt to match these. If they do not match, we will never return from a recursive call—they will have used the `escape` function to jump directly to the `callCC` point in `test_pattern`. If they return, the pattern did match the expression, and we return the `match_env` that now contains any variables that were bound in the matching.

If `test_expr` is not a function call, it might still be a constructor. If it is, then it will be a symbol and the symbol will be a variable in the `eval_env` scope—we test this with the `exists` function. These two tests only tell us that there is a variable with the name from `test_expr` in `eval_env`. Not that it is a constant constructor. To test this, we get the value the variable return to, using the `get` function, and checks if it has an attribute called `"constructor_constant"`. If it does, then that is the name of the constructor, and we can test that against the value in `expr` that will either be the object that represents the constant—in which case we have a match—or it will be something else—in which case we escape.

If we get past the first two tests, we do not have a constructor. We now either have a value that we must test against `expr`, or we have a variable that we should bind to the value of `expr`. Here, I have decided that any symbol will be interpreted as a variable that should be bound and anything else should be a value that we evaluate and compared against `expr`. We could also have checked if the variable was bound and used its value in that case, but that could very clearly lead to hard-to-fix bugs. In any case, you can always use quasi-quoting to achieve the same effect.

```{r}
x <- 1
y <- 2
cases(L(1),
      L(!!x) -> "x",
      L(!!y) -> "y")
```

So, we bind any variable by assigning the value of `expr` to the symbol in the `match_env` environment. Anything that isn’t a symbol should be a value that is the same as `expr`. To get this value, we evaluate the `test_expr` in the `eval_env`.

That was the entire implementation of pattern matching. It might not be trivial code, but it is not horribly complicated either, and we have created a very efficient language in less than 200 lines of code.

We can try it out, now, by implementing a depth-first traversal of the binary tree type we defined earlier. The function below is a simple traversal that adds together all the values found in leaves. The `match` call consider the basis case—a leaf—and the recursive case—a tree with a `left` and `right` sub-tree—and doesn’t need an `otherwise` case.

```{r}
dft <- function(tree) {
  cases(tree,
        L(v) -> v,
        T(left, right) -> dft(left) + dft(right))
}

dft(L(1))
dft(T(L(1),L(2)))
dft(T(T(L(1),L(2)),L(3)))
```

## Lists

We have used linked lists many places in this book, but the functions we have used had to access the list elements in a `list`. We can define linked lists using our new language like this:

```{r}
linked_list := NIL | CONS(car, cdr : linked_list)
```

A list is either empty, we use the constant `NIL` to represent that, or it has a head element, `car`, and a tail, `cdr`. Since we implement values we construct from our language as `list` objects, we automatically get the linked-list implementation form this specification.

With pattern matching, we can write very simple functions for manipulating lists. For example, the following function reverses a list using an accumulator list. In the base case, when the first list is empty, we return the accumulator. Otherwise, we take the head of the list and prepend it to the accumulated and then recurse. We `force` evaluation of the accumulator to avoid lazy evaluation. With lazy evaluation, we would be building larger and later `CONS` expressions that would not be evaluated until the end of the recursion. At this point, we might have built the expression too large for the stack space needed to evaluate the functions (see, e.g. @Mailund:2017ii and @Mailund:2017ul for explanations of how recursion and lazy evaluation can collide to exceed the stack space).

```{r}
reverse_list <- function(lst, acc = NIL) {
  force(acc)
  cases(lst,
        NIL -> acc,
        CONS(car, cdr) -> reverse_list(cdr, CONS(car, acc)))
}
```

We can write a very similar function to compute the length of a list. This will follow the same pattern of using an accumulator, which we return in the base case and update in the recursive case.

```{r}
list_length <- function(lst, acc = 0) {
  force(acc)
  cases(lst,
        NIL -> acc,
        CONS(car, cdr) -> list_length(cdr, acc + 1))
}
```

A function for translating a linked list into a `list` object is a little more involved, but can still be written succinctly using pattern matching. We need to figure out the length of the `list` object first, then allocate it, and finally iterate through the linked list to update the `list`. We use a closure, `f`, to recursively traverse the linked list. In the base case, I return `NULL`. It doesn’t matter what we return here since we only do the recursion for its side-effects, which are handled in the recursive case. Here, I use a code block—the curly-braces operator—to evaluate two statements. The first update the list `v` and the second continue the recursion. It is precisely because we use tidy evaluation that this function works. It is essential that the assignment we do in the recursive case is evaluated in the environment where we write the expression. Otherwise, we would not be updating the correct list.

```{r}
list_to_vector <- function(lst) {
  n <- list_length(lst)
  v <- vector("list", length = n)
  f <- function(lst, i) {
    force(i)
    cases(lst,
          NIL -> NULL,
          CONS(car, cdr) -> {
            v[[i]] <<- car
            f(cdr, i + 1)
            }
          )
  }
  f(lst, 1)
  v %>% unlist
}
```

Translating a `list` to a linked list is simple enough and doesn’t use any pattern matching—we cannot pattern match on `list` objects, after all.

```{r}
vector_to_list <- function(vec) {
  lst <- NIL
  for (i in seq_along(vec)) {
    lst <- CONS(vec[[i]], lst)
  }
  reverse_list(lst)
}
```

With these few functions, we can translate to and from vectors and work with lists. 

```{r}
lst <- vector_to_list(1:5)
list_length(lst)
list_to_vector(lst)
lst %>% reverse_list %>% list_to_vector
```

Extending the functionality of linked lists with additional functions, I will leave as an exercise to the interested reader. You can experiment to your heart's desire.

## Search trees

As another example, we can implement search trees. These are trees, containing ordered values, that satisfy the recursive property that all elements in the left sub-tree of a search tree will have values less than the value stored at the root of the tree, and all elements in the right sub-tree of a search tree will have values larger than the value in the root.

To define search trees, we try a different approach than the binary trees from earlier. We define an empty tree, `E`, and a tree with two sub-trees, `left` and `right`, and a `value`.

```{r}
search_tree := 
  E | T(left : search_tree, value, right : search_tree)
```

We will just implement two functions for the example, insertion and test for membership. For more functions on search tree, I will refer to @Mailund:2017ul [chapter 6].

Both functions search recursively down the tree until they either find the value they want to insert or want to check is in the three, respectively. For insertion, the base case, when it hits a leaf, is to insert the element there. It will create a tree, with two empty sub-trees, containing the value. The recursive function builds a tree in the recursion by using the `T` constructor to create new trees in each recursive call. Thus, the tree created at a leaf will be put into the updated tree that the `insert` function creates. For the `member` function, we do not need to update the tree. If we hit a leaf, we know that the element is not in the tree and we can just return `FALSE`. In both functions, the search checks the value in the tree they see in the recursive case. If the value there is greater than `x`, then the only place `x` could be found would be in the left sub-tree, so we continue the search there. If, on the other hand, `x` is greater than the value, then we must search in the right sub-tree. If it is neither smaller than or greater than the value, it must be equal to the value. For insertion, this means we do not have to do anything, and we can just return the tree that already contains `x`. For the membership test, we can return `TRUE`.

```{r}
insert <- function(tree, x) {
  cases(tree,
        E -> T(E, x, E),
        T(left, val, right) -> {
          if (x < val)
            T(insert(left, x), val, right)
          else if (x > val)
            T(left, val, insert(right, x))
          else
            T(left, x, right)
        })
}

member <- function(tree, x) {
  cases(tree,
        E -> FALSE,
        T(left, val, right) -> {
          if (x < val) member(left, x)
          else if (x > val) member(right, x)
          else TRUE
        })
}
```

We can build a tree like this:

```{r}
tree <- E
for (i in sample(2:4))
  tree <- insert(tree, i)
```

Once built, we can test membership like this:

```{r}
for (i in 1:6) {
  cat(i, " : ", member(tree, i), "\\n")
}
```

The worst-case time usage for both of these functions is proportional to the depth of the tree, and that can be linear in the number of elements stored in the tree. If we keep the tree balanced, though, the time is reduced to logarithmic in the size of the tree. A classical data structure for keeping search trees balanced is so-called *red-black* search trees. Implementing these using pointer or reference manipulation in languages such as C/C++ or Java can be quite challenging, but in a functional language, balancing such trees is a simple matter of transforming trees based on local structure, see, e.g. @Okasaki:1999fd, @Germane:2014et, or @Mailund:2017ul.

Red-black search trees are binary search trees where each tree has a colour associated, either red or black. We can define colours using constructors like this:

```{r}
colour :=
  R | B
```

We add a colour to all non-empty trees like this:

```{r}
rb_tree :=
  E | T(col : colour, left : rb_tree, value, right : rb_tree)
```

Except for including the colour in the pattern matching, the `member` function for this data structure is the same as for the plain search tree.

```{r}
member <- function(tree, x) {
  cases(tree,
        E -> FALSE,
        T(col, left, val, right) -> {
          if (x < val) member(left, x)
          else if (x > val) member(right, x)
          else TRUE
        })
}

tree <- T(R, E, 2, T(B, E, 5, E))
for (i in 1:6) {
  cat(i, " : ", member(tree, i), "\\n")
}
```

What keeps red-black search trees balanced is that we always enforce these two invariants:

1. No red node has a red parent.
2. Every path from the root to a leaf has the same number of black nodes.

If every path from root to a leaf has the same number of black nodes, then the tree is perfectly balanced if we ignored the red nodes. Since no red node has a red parent, the longest path, when red nodes are considered, can be no longer than twice the length of the shortest path.

These invariants can be guaranteed by always inserting new values in red leaves, potentially invalidating the first invariant, and then rebalancing all sub-trees that invalidate this invariant, and at the end setting the root to be black. The rebalancing is done when returning from the recursive insertion calls that otherwise work as insertion in the plain search tree.

```{r}
insert_rec <- function(tree, x) {
  cases(tree,
        E -> T(R, E, x, E),
        T(col, left, val, right) -> {
          if (x < val)
            balance(T(col, insert_rec(left, x), val, right))
          else if (x > val)
            balance(T(col, left, val, insert_rec(right, x)))
          else
            T(col, left, x, right) # already here
        })
}
insert <- function(tree, x) {
  tree <- insert_rec(tree, x)
  tree$col <- B
  tree
}
```

The transformation rules for the `balance` function are shown in [@fig:RBT-transformations]. Whenever we see any of the four trees on the edges, we have to transform it into the one in the middle. The implementation I presented in @Mailund:2017ul contained mostly code for testing the structure of the tree to match and very little to construct the modified tree. With pattern matching, we can implement these rules by matching for each of the four cases like this:

![Re-balancing transformations when inserting into a red-black search tree.](figures/RBT-transformations){#fig:RBT-transformations}

```{r}
balance <- function(tree) {
  cases(tree,
        T(B,T(R,a,x,T(R,b,y,c)),z,d) -> T(R,T(B,a,x,b),y,T(B,c,z,d)),
        T(B,T(R,T(R,a,x,b),y,c),z,d) -> T(R,T(B,a,x,b),y,T(B,c,z,d)),
        T(B,a,x,T(R,b,y,T(R,c,z,d))) -> T(R,T(B,a,x,b),y,T(B,c,z,d)),
        T(B,a,x,T(R,T(R,b,y,c),z,d)) -> T(R,T(B,a,x,b),y,T(B,c,z,d)),
        otherwise -> tree)
}
```

This is the function we used to motivate the domain-specific language, and so we come full circle, having implemented the language we wanted.
